Algorithms Coursework 1

Implement a Partical Simulator in Java capable of visually displaying 3 different simulations:

```SimpleSimulation.java```
```DiffusionSimulation.java```
```BrownianSimulation.java```

Particle collisions contained in ```MinPriorityQueue.java``` implemented as a queue which runs in O(log n) time
